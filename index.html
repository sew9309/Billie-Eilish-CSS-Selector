    <p>Amazing P tag text...</p>
        <p>Billie Eilish is the best singer in the entire world. She is my favorite singer, my idol, my everything. I have been listening to her for a few years now and am obsessed with every song she has put out. She truly cannot write a bad song...except for her last release "Lo Vas a Olvidar." What the heck is up with that one. To be fair, it kinda works for the scene in Euphoria it was made for...but still.</p>
        <p>Billie is one of the youngest successful artists on the planet. She's literally my age...ouch.</p>
